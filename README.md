# Foundation For Public Code Jekyll Theme Starter Kit

Contentless website to be used with the Foundation For Public Code Jekyll theme and GitHub pages.

This site builds with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), as is the default of [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) and uses the [Foundation For Public Code Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/publiccodenet/jekyll-theme).

## Installing locally

1. To build the site locally make sure you have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Bundlr](https://bundler.io/) installed.
2. Install the dependencies of this repo with 
```bash
$ bundle install
```

## Serving Locally

1. Run the Jekyll server with 
```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```
2. You can now view the website locally on `http://localhost:4000`

The server will rebuild the site every time a file changes, with the exception of `_config.yml`.
